# ARdemo-AndroidApp
Android App for grabbing and displaying UDP stream from computer. Then splitting image to allow for AR 

This is used as the recieving end of a custom UDP stream. No on the market applications were real time so we developed our own.
The App is quite simple and was made very quickly so I usually needs to be modified on a per phone version basis.
